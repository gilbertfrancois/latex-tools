## lxlc: LaTeX label counter

When working on large documents, it can happen that a label for a figure or table has been duplicated, causing all references to be replaced by ??. Finding duplicate labels can be a tedious task. This small utility scans the document(s) and shows all used labels with the line number where they are defined. If a label has been duplicated, it shows a warning.



Example usage:

```
$ lxlc test.tex

label                          | line number          | status
-------------------------------+----------------------+---------
                    20230309-1 |                   33 | [  OK  ]
                    20230309-2 |                   42 | [  OK  ]
                    20230309-3 |                   64 | [  OK  ]
                    20230309-4 |                   83 | [  OK  ]

## Installation

- Make sure you have a recent version of python3 installed and that `/usr/bin/python3 --version` works. The apps don't need any additional libraries.
